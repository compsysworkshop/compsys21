## About COMPSYS:
The future of computing systems is inevitably embracing a disaggregated and composable pattern: from clusters of computers to pools of resources that can be dynamically combined together and tailored around applications requirements. Transitioning to this new paradigm requires ground-breaking researchranging from new hardware architectures up to new models and abstractions at all levels of the software stack.COMPSYS brings together the expertise of researchers and developers from academia and industry on all aspects of composable systems design, management and use.
