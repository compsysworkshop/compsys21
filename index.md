# First Workshop on Composable Systems (COMPSYS '22)

## About COMPSYS:
The future of computing systems is inevitably embracing a disaggregated and composable pattern: from clusters of computers to pools of resources that can be dynamically combined together and tailored around applications requirements. Transitioning to this new paradigm requires ground-breaking researchranging from new hardware architectures up to new models and abstractions at all levels of the software stack.COMPSYS brings together the expertise of researchers and developers from academia and industry on all aspects of composable systems design, management and use.

Attendance to this workshop is included with the IPDPS 2022 registration. ~~Register [here](https://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2022/2022-registration.html).~~ Registration is closed.

**The First Workshop on Composable System (COMPSYS) held in tandem with the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS) 2022 has concluded. We would like to thank all authors, attendees and organizers for the successful workshop.**
