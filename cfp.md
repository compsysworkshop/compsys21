# First Workshop on Composable Systems (COMPSYS '22)

## Call for Papers

The future of computing systems is inevitably embracing a disaggregated and composable pattern: from clusters of computers to pools of resources that can be dynamically combined together and tailored around applications requirements. Transitioning to this new paradigm requires ground-breaking researchranging from new hardware architectures up to new models and abstractions at all levels of the software stack.COMPSYS brings together the expertise of researchers and developers from academia and industry on all aspects of composable systems design, management and use.

Papers are solicited from the areas, including, but not limited to:
- Hardware architectures for composability
- Control plane software for management of composable systems
- Composability for Cloud and HPC
	- Challenges in shifting to dynamically composable infrastructures
- Evaluation of applications on composable systems
- Failure and resilience models for composable systems
- Composable system prototypes
- Programming models for composable systems
- Modelling of composable systems
- Memory and storage technologies for composable system
- Power, energy, and thermal management for composable systems
- Analysis / profiling tools and techniques for composable systems
- Software Architectures for composable systems

### Submission information:
Manuscripts should be anonymized for double-blind review.•Papers are subject to a maximum length of 6 pages including figures and references.•Submissions should follow the same formatting rules of the MICRO conference template.
